The use of this website is to showcase and sell jackets for hiking and outdoors.

## Description

My project for this was to create a website/online store for a company called "Rainydays".
We were given some points that we had to follow but rest was up to us. At first we made it with only CSS/HTML as we didn't learn JS at that time. But once we knew how to do JS, we were tasked to fetch the products via rest api, so that it was more structured and the checkout were properly working with grabbing the products id's and stuff.

Some of the required things for the page

- Fetching products via REST API.
- Responsive on all sizes, mobile and desktop.
- Different jackets and fetching IDs so we could take the product to another page and grab the details there.

## Built With

To make this website we basically were only allowed to use basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
